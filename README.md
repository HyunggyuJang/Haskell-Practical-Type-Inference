# Notes

From (Jones et al. 2007), you can learn about the definition of impredicative, which often appears when you work on theorem proving using ITP, such as Coq (Team 2022):  

> A type system that allows a polymorphic function to be instantiated at a polytype is called *impredicative*, while a predicative system only allows a polymorphic function to be instantiated with a monotype.
