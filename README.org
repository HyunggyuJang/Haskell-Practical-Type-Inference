* Working in progress
Currently working on [cite:@jonesPracticalTypeInference2007]
* Notes
From [cite:@jonesPracticalTypeInference2007], you can learn about the definition of impredicative, which often appears when you work on theorem proving using ITP, such as Coq [cite:@teamCoqProofAssistant2022]:
#+begin_quote
A type system that allows a polymorphic function to be instantiated at a polytype is called /impredicative/, while a predicative system only allows a polymorphic function to be instantiated with a monotype.
